## The App
On the other day you get a phone call of someone called Charles, Charles Francis Xavier, he prefers to be called
Professor X. After elaborately sifting through the yellow pages he has come across your phone number as the most 
excellent freelance developer. You won't turn down this great opportunity and immediately ask him more about his wishes. 
Charles tells you that his Cerebro is broken and wants an upgrade so that discovering mutants will be even easier.
He has used Cerebro to easily discover hidden mutants in the area. 

*Unfortunately google maps has changed its policy while I was working on this app. Now you have to supply a creditcard
otherwise a grey development layer will occur. That's way you see a gray overlay, the functionality will stay the same
and should not interfere with learning new stuff :)*

## Blog

Through the blog series you will create this app.
The blog series goes into depth on how to implement google maps in a maintainable en flexible manner. Serveral topics
will be discussed.
- Typescript
- ES6 js
- State management store principles
- Rxjs observable streams
- Infrastructure for creating new google map component easily in a DRY manner

It has been fun making it and I hope will learn at least one thing or two
that would help you further on your own journey.
